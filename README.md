I decided to use the GNU General Public license v3. I mainly chose this because it is a free copyleft license which means it's able to be freely copied, modified, and distributed without there being any restrictions.
This allows anyone to use my software for whatever purpose they wanted to be it commmercial or private while stating the changes they made, add the original source, and use the same license I used. 
I personally love anything and everything that is free and lets me use it for whatever I want. This doesn't slow down innovation and advancement of technology and allows anyone of any financial background
to have free access to this software. I also prefer to use open source since there is a community of people that make free updates to the software which make the experience of using it better for everyone.
